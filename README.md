# SRE Academy Labs

This repo contains content for SRE Academy labs.

## Deploying a lab

Each lab will have its own instructions for deployment. To find the available labs, navigate to the `Labs` directory. Once in the lab directory, use the content in the `labGuides` directory for next steps, depending on if you are in a student role or instructor role.

## Creating a new lab

Defining a new lab is done by adding a lab directory to the `Labs` folder. For more details on the process and considerations for lab content, reference the [SRE Academy Lab Guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/azsre/EcwSMcSTagJDpjKfUpAp82EB7lLDHyve2l_C2zwHkBOT5w?e=ykfNRZ).
